  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.
*/

  this.isFlying = false;
}
Airplane.prototype.takeOff = function () {
  this.isFlying = true;
};

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:

        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Window Binding- If none of the other rules apply, the "this" prints to the Window. If you're in strict mode the code will return undefined.
  2. Implicit Binding- This only applies to an object with methods (methods are when a FUNCTION is stored as an OBJECT property)
  3. Explicit Binding- 
  Call - Immediately invokes the function. With .call you pass in arguments 1 by 1.
// Apply - Immediately invokes the function. With .apply you pass in arguments as an array.
// Bind - Arguments are passed in 1 by 1, but they do not immediately invoke the function. It returns a new function that can be invoked later on.

All of the above state what the "this" keyword refers to.

  4. New Binding- The keyword "new" constructs a new object and "this" then refers to it. When a function is invoked as a constructor function using the "new" keyword, "this" refers to the new object that's created. Proper syntax is to caplitalize the function name of a Constructor Function.

  BONUS PRINCIPLE- When Arrow functions are used, "this" retains the same value as it's parent.
